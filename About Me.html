	Hello my name is Maria Medina, I am an upcoming Senior at Coral Reef Senior High who really enjoys laughing, especially when it is related to memes. 
My experience during the summer so far, here at Girls Who Code, has honestly been really fun and it is nice to see the various projects I have made during the process.
